# MLEssentials

**MLEssentials** is a powerful Python package designed to support a broad range of machine learning tasks. It integrates essential libraries and tools for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization. With MLEssentials, you can streamline your machine learning workflows and focus more on solving problems and less on managing dependencies.

## Features

- **Data Manipulation**: Utilizes libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `polars`, and `pandasql` for efficient data handling and manipulation.
- **Model Building**: Supports various model-building frameworks including `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `catboost`, and `statsmodels`.
- **Visualization**: Provides tools for creating plots and visualizations with `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, and `pydot`.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Incorporates `nltk`, `spacy`, and `pattern` for advanced text processing and analysis.
- **Web and API Interactions**: Includes `fastapi`, `flask`, `selenium`, and `requests` for web scraping and building web applications.
- **Data Storage and Retrieval**: Features `SQLAlchemy`, `mysql-connector`, and `pyodbc` for database connectivity and operations.
- **Additional Utilities**: Offers `joblib`, `pydantic`, `openpyxl`, `pyarrow`, `networkx`, and `beautifulsoup` for extended functionalities.

## Installation

To install **MLEssentials**, use the following `pip` command:

```bash
pip install MLEssentials
```
## Usage
Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use MLEssentials in your machine learning project:


```python
# Importing necessary libraries from MLEssentials
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load and preprocess data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Visualize results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(range(len(y_test)), y_test, label='True Values')
plt.plot(range(len(y_test)), model.predict(X_test), label='Predicted Values', linestyle='--')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
